As of 2013-08-29, pedestrian development has been officially retired (as opposed to unofficially up to this point). It's a decent tech demo, and a good place to start if you're interested in seeing a working Slick2d project, or want to see how one might implement exponential resistence-based turning and avoidance systems, but my plans for pedestrians itself (and projects based on similar ideas) have changed in the last month.

====================

Pedestrians is a simulator for pedestrian movement. It's fun, it's light, it's a tech demo at this point.

As of July 2011, the project has been in development for barely more than a month. Here's a basic rundown of what the project currently does:
1. Launch it with "StartPedestrians.class"
2. A number of pedestrians are randomly generated and placed around the world.
3. The world is full of randomly placed obstacles (red blocks)
4. Pedestrians avoid running into/through these blocks, as well as other pedestrians
